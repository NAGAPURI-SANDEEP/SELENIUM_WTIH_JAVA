structured : - C, python,
object based :  -Vb script, python
object oriented :  -c++,java, c#, python

if a programming language supports a 

		object, 
		class,
		inheritence ,
		polymorphism, 
		encapsulation, 
		Abstraction,

Features :

		1.Platform Independent
		2.java is case sensitive language

Components:

		JDK--Java Development KIt (To develop java based applications)-->To develop any program using java

 		JRE--Java Runtime Environment (by default install from jdk)-->To run any java based  program.

 		JVM--Java virtual Machine (by default install from JRE)-->

		To translate from one langauge (English) to another language (Bytecode) , compile (check errors) the program and execute the program

1.CORE JAVE : 

2.ADVANCED JAVA :


Environment set up:

		 1.JDK/java
 		 2.IDE (ECLIPSE)

Versions :	
		 Java 1-8 sun microsystems (OPEN SOURCE)
	  	 Java 9-Oracle 
	  	 For selenium java jdk 11+ version is better 
	  	 Eclipse can get any verion which is latest

		After install jdk, then set java path in environment variables

		Install Eclipse with latest version (any verison is okay) from google 


		Create a new java project --File--> New-----> Java Project
		create a new java package --src-->package
		Create a new class ---------------> Package-->new class
	
		To increase front size in window in eclipse CTRL+
		To run the java program ctrl+f11 is the short cut key

		every statement end with the semicolon, but not applies for class and method 
		doble quotations are only to print exactly like strings 
		to perfrom any operations we should  not use quotation

Naming conventions:
		1.class name should be start with uppercase
		2.not sart with number	
		3.contain underscore and number are allowed 
		4.not hypen

COMMENTS:To improve readability //

		1.single line comments 
		2.multi line comments

Variable 	:  A variable is a container whcih can store data. 
	   	 Variable can be a stored memory location.
	   	 which we can retrieve the data and access the data

		int number =100	
		float itemnumber = 12.50
		int age=30
		String name= "JHONNY"
		char grade = 'A'

Data Type	: Represents What type of data storing  into the variable is called data type.

Two cateogories : Primitive , 
		  non primitive/derived/ collections/--> data types 

PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES:These are used to used to store single data into single varible

	1.byte(1)------number without decimal-->(-128 to 127)
	2.short(2)-----number without decimal-->(-32768 to 32767)
	3.int(4)-------number without decimal-->(-2147483648 to 2147483647)
	4.long(8)------number without decimal-->(-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775808)

	5.float(4)-----decimal value ---------->(after decimal -7 decimal digits)-->
	
	The value wich is adding at end ofvalue is called literal (f)

	6.double(8)----decimal value ---------->(after decimal -15 decimal digits)

	7.char(2)------single character-------->(1 byte)

	8.boolen(1)----true or false----------->(2 byte)

NON_PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES : These are used to hold multiple data values  in to single varible

	1.String
	2.Array
	3.Arraylist
	4.Object
	5.File
	6.Hashmap
	7.Hashset etc



JAVA  is statically typed programming Language 

int x= 100; 
x= "welcome" // not possible

PYTHON is dynamically typed programming language

x=100;
x="welcome" //possible
